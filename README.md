# Human_Activity_Recognition
Predict the human activity using smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope readings

## Overview

- This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

- This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

- Accelerometer and Gyroscope readings are taken from 30 volunteers(referred as subjects) while performing the following 6 Activities.
  - Walking
  - WalkingUpstairs
  - WalkingDownstairs
  - Standing
  - Sitting
  - Lying.

## Problem Statement
Given a new datapoint we have to predict the Activity
